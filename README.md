Implementing an E-commerce Web API utilising Asp.net web api together with the clean architecture pattern which enables developers to develop applications focusing on modularity,maintainability and testability. In building the application, I am utilising a variety of libraries/packages which are important in development productivity and ensuring the application is built with the highest level of quality possible :
